# Labview
In this repository, I put my labview projects and notes. 
The first program I made was ![Basic Algebra](https://github.com/Roxa-na/Labview/tree/main/basicAlgebra). It takes two numbers and the user must choose the operator for the program to execute the action. More detail on this program is found in ![my wiki](https://github.com/Roxa-na/Labview.wiki).
