I made this program so I could learn working on myRio. I started with the button and the 4 LEDs present there.
The idea is that once the program starts the first LED is on and the others are off. Once the user pushes the button the next LED turns on and as long as the button is pushed the LEDs shift turning on. Basically at each second, one LED is on and the others are off.

This was a good practice to learn more about working with myRio, clusters and shiftregisters.
